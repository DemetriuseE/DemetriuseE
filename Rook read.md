- 👋 Hi, I’m Demetrius
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, coding, life applications, philosophy, motivation, and better ways to live.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and other forms of coding to get a greater understanding of video game design, phone application designs, website structuring, and more.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything you would want to guide someone through.
- 📫 You can reach me at Lunarshisa14@gmail.com throughout most normal hours and sometimes early in the morning. I look forward to hearing from you.

- Feel free to shoot me a message or email. Have a great day.
